# financial_sentiment
This Jupyter Notebook contains all the code and experimentation I did to perform sentiment analysis using SKLearn.

## Usage
### On Kaggle Notebook
To run this on Kaggle, download the notebook and import it into Kaggle. It should run out of the box.
### With requirements.txt (local)
While I provide the requirements.txt file, this contains every library with a Kaggle notebook. It's possible to do:
```console
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install close to 700 libraries, though, and it would be better to extract the specific libraries needed one by one.
